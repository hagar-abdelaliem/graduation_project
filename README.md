## who are we
  - We are three students in the Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University who are computer science lovers, <br/> 
    and our goal is to know something about everything and to know everything about something. This is our graduation project and we chose this project for the             students and doctors of the Botany Department to benefit from in the hope that it will help them in their studies and make it easier. And we ask God for success.

      - she brought some hard copy of pdfs and explained the slides dividsion<br/>
      - then we went to botany department and we saw all slides and boxes and how she orgainzed them in actual life  <br/> 
      - we created a whatsApp group and added DA and AS. <br/>
  - Notes
      - As students it is very hard to understand the total system.<br/>
      - this database will take a lot of time to made this.<br/>
  - Tasks
      - [x] we will make database analysts, we made requirement gathering. <br />

      - we still need a lot of other details and data to understand the requirments.<br/>
  - Tasks
      - [x] we will start our jop as a database architect, we start the design phase of database. <br/>

      - we made this database but it have some problem
          - when we made this design we found that there is a many to many relationship between weak entity and strong entity.<br/>
          - the plants divides into 3 catogary , in each catogary there exist different groups of plants , we thought that the number of plant is unique but in each group she start the number of plants from 1 again.<br/>
          - we have no data and we asked AS to send us the data.<br/>
          - we don't know if the person can borrow more than one slide or not
  - Tasks
      - [x] each one of us will search about solution for this prolems.<br/>
      - [x] we ask AS if the person can borrow more than one slide or not
      - [x] we will go to botany deprment again to see the slides and boxes angain because we data still not clear to us
