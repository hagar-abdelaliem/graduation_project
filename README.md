# Digital System For Botany Slides
## who are we
  - We are three students in the Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University who are computer science lovers, <br/> 
    and our goal is to know something about everything and to know everything about something. This is our graduation project and we chose this project for the             students and doctors of the Botany Department to benefit from in the hope that it will help them in their studies and make it easier. And we ask God for success.

## Project
| Background | objective | Description | Skills |  
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- |
|The department of Botany provides a variety of plant-related slides. These slides are available for loan, however it is difficult to keep track of who has borrowed what and when it is due back|Develop a system for storing and displaying data on plant slides available|Develop an Android/web-based application that allows the user (student, admin, faculty member) to view the slides, search for specific factions, borrow permissible slides (depending on the user type) to study on within a specific time period, and manage slides.|DB , Mobile|

       MW, HA, RH, AS and DA
  - what we did
      - we go to AS in her office <br/>
      - she explained some details about the system which she did and currently used in botany<br/>
      - she told us that she built a total system for all plants slides and she start from scratch<br/>
      - she explained how she did this system and how she organized the slides <br/>
      - she brought some hard copy of pdfs and explained the slides dividsion<br/>
      - then we went to botany department and we saw all slides and boxes and how she orgainzed them in actual life  <br/> 
  - Notes
      - As students it is very hard to understand the total system.<br/>
      - this database will take a lot of time to made this.<br/>
  - Tasks
      - [x] HA created a whatsApp group and added DA and AS. <br/>
      - [x] we will make database analysts, we made requirement gathering. 
      - [x] We will analyze and organize the requirements and interpreted statistical information based on the data.

  - Notes
      - we discussed about the database and how each one us understood the data and requirments of project.
      - the database is hard the be undertood from the first time.
      - we still need a lot of other details and data to understand the requirments.<br/>
  - Tasks
      - [x] we will start our jop as a database architect, we start the design phase of database. 
      - [x] each one of us will design the database and we will meet at 24/10/2022 to disccus our designs.

      - we made this database but it have some problem
          - when we made this design we found that there is a many to many relationship between weak entity and strong entity.
          - the plants divides into 3 catogary , in each catogary there exist different groups of plants , we thought that the number of plant is unique but in each group she start the number of plants from 1 again.
          - we have no data and we asked AS to send us the data.
          - we don't know if the person can borrow more than one slide or not
  - Tasks
      - [x] each one of us will search about solution for this prolems.<br/>
      - [x] we ask AS if the person can borrow more than one slide or not
      - [x] we will go to botany deprment again to see the slides and boxes angain because we data still not clear to us

      RH , HA, MW , AS
  - Notes
      - AS sent a excal sheet which have some data and we make a design before we went to AS, but this is a very little part of data , and not the same data which is treat with in actual.<br/>
      - AS not send us any another data , and this is a big problem for us because every time we decide to make a design we have a big conflict
      - we asked AS to send data many times but she apologized because she had a problem in her laptop

      - Problems
          - what is the meaning of 1.1
          - how there exist 2 boxes with number 2.1
      - Discussion
          - we went to AS to ask her about this problems
          - we went to Botany deparment and saw all slides again
          - there is a big problem such that we found that the number of boxes is not the same in all categores, which is mean that all category, and we must make a new design for database.
          - we take a Pictures for slides and boxes

## 29/10/2022

      DA, MW , HA ,RH
  - What we did
      - we met Dr. DA in his office to discuss what we have come to in the design of the Database and the following picture contains what we have come to before               meeting him. 
          - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75702509/199990844-7c0bb587-0cae-468e-86d6-ff775e8e0067.png).
      - Dr. DA informed us of some modifications to our design to make it better and easier to obtain information (For this, thank you, Dr.DA).
  - Notes
      - Despite the many modifications that occurred to the design and every time a defect appeared and we fixed it, we were never disappointed and did not lose our           enthusiasm, but we were happier because we learned a lot from these mistakes. We know very well that as long as there are mistakes, this means that we learn           more.
  - Tasks
      - [x] hold an online meeting to finalize the database design on 2/11/2022.
## 2/11/2022
  - Participations <br/>
      MW , HA ,RH
  - What we did
      - We held an online meeting to finalize the database design (Conceptual Schema), It was the best meeting we've ever had, it was full of valuable information and         a broad understanding of the database.
      - We deleted the table of students, admin and doctors and were satisfied with only one table, since the data we are interested in is one for each of them, so             there is no need to make different tables.
  - Problems
      - MW discovered a problem in the table of cells for each plant and found that if we only made the id of the plant and its cells to be the distinctive key                 of this table, this key could be repeated with another plant classification.
          - the solution was that he suggested that we add with them the classification color.
              - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75702509/199990702-034b6147-cbac-42f7-ae47-4712c91ec994.png).
      - RH also discovered another problem with the count of plants, which we previously made it as an attribute of the plant table, but each plant has different              sectors with different counts. Therefore, we will not be able to determine the count of all the sector for each plant separately because the sectors for each          plant are shown in a different table.
          - the solution was to add the count attribute to section type table.
              - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75702509/200062653-cd41e5bc-7a35-4ce2-8e6e-e8e4f1bcd93a.png).
  - Finally, this is what we reached after 6 hours of modifications, discussions and suggestions, and we are really proud of what we have achieved. This is what we got     after working hard for more than two weeks.
